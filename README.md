# Vår 2014 - Spring Template
Vår 2014 is my first publicly released template. It incorporates a few techniques i've been practicing over the last few months and i'd be delighted for you to use and share it as much as you want. A lot of effort went into building this template so please dont pass off **my work** as your own; not cool!

If you do use it then i do not expect to be credited for your adaptations; but i wont be upset if you link to my [Twitter](http://twitter.com/mattsince87).

## How's it made?
I've used **SCSS**, **Jquery** and **HTML5** to build the main architecture on the site. I have also used **SnapSVG** to create the awesome flying airplane on the finance form at the top of the page!

* Bootstrap 3.1.1
* SCSS
* Jquery
* HTML5
* SnapSVG
* [CodeKit](https://incident57.com/codekit/)
* [CodePen](http://codepen.io)

## Web Comaptibility

I've built this template on the most recent version of Chrome and have tested in the most recent versions of the following:

## Mobile Compatibility

As a responsive website the layout should work seemlessly across all new mobile devices. It has been tested on iOS7 and Android Jellybean.

## Editors Notes

#### Thank you!
I would also like to give a huge credit to [CodePen](http://codepen.io) and its community for allowing me to develop each part of this template and the feedback i've received! It's very humbling to learn my code is being used and/or helping people to learn!

#### In the future...
This is currently the first publicly released version i have made. I do intend to curate this template and improve the efficiency of the **SCSS** and **Jquery** where i can.

*I plan to make a **HAML** version for all the uber cool **Ruby** des out there!*
